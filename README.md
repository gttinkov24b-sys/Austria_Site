# Austria site(private site)
---
For a project at school, I made this static website using HTML to practice basic web development skills, including page structure, frames/iframes, and styling.
---
### What I learnt:
- How to work with iframes
- how to improve the website structure to avoid "broken" layouts
- Organising my file structure better
